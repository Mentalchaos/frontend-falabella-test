It's required to make an app like this one, a pixabay search term photo finder like the video below

(You can watch this video using a webm player or using google chrome)


**These are the restrictions**:

- You have 1 hour left to complete this test.
- Only photos greater than 300px width are allowed.
- Only photos greater than 300px height are allowed.
- Just photos with a width greater than their height should be shown.
- The difference between width and height must not be greater than 250 pixels.(A square like photo is a lot better than a rectangle)
- If you press ENTER key while you are inside search term input, it must trigger the AJAX call.
- If you click on an image it should open a new tab showing you the refer URL(that URL is provided in the json response).
- **To filter photos by width or height you must use javascript, not via API**.
- **The code must be written in english**

You can use this docs for further explanation about this API.

### Create this environment

1. Install dependencies
```shell
$ npm install
```

1. Run this server
```shell
$ npm run start
```


This test must be sent via **[weTransfer]**(https://wetransfer.com/) in a ZIP format, wetransfer method must be a shared URL. It is going to be uncompressed and tested(**after installing any dependencies that you might have declared in package.json**).




### Bonus points:

1. Use a template engine like Handlebars to create HTML.
1. Use ReactJS to model this app.
1. Code all the app in a functional way.
