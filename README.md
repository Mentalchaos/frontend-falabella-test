**These are the restrictions**:

- You have 1 hour left to complete this test.
- Only photos greater than 300px width are allowed.
- Only photos greater than 300px height are allowed.
- Just photos with a width greater than their height should be shown.
- The difference between width and height must not be greater than 250 pixels.(A square like photo is a lot better than a rectangle)
- **To filter photos by width or height you must use javascript, not via API**.

### Create this environment

1. Install dependencies
```shell
$ npm install
```

1. Run this server
```shell
$ npm run start
```


This test must be sent via email in a ZIP format. It is going to be uncompressed and tested(**after installing any dependencies that you might have declared in package.json**).


### Bonus points:

1. Use a template engine like Handlebars to create HTML.
1. Use ReactJS to model this app.
1. Code all the functionality in a functional way.
